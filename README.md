<h1>Inspiration</h1>
Users can use emojis to express their emotions and thoughts, such as the “reaction” feature on Facebook. But such emoji-dependent picture icons rarely represent the users’ feelings accurately and precisely. Further, even the users themselves cannot put their feelings into words promptly all the time. After identifying this limitation of general online chatting, we decided to develop a chatting app that can deeply analyze the users’ emotion when they are messaging their friends.

<h1>What it does</h1>
 
Our project includes a live camera to gather data regarding the user’s facial expression, a chat box for users to exchange messages, and an emo-analyzing chart that updates its analysis result of the users’ emotion every time when a new message is sent. During the conversation, the users can view both their own and their counterpart’s emotion analysis result.

<h1>How we built it</h1>
We used Microsoft Face API to analyze users’ facial expression. We also use Twilio Chat API for creating real-time messaging feature. For the front end development, we use React and Redux.
